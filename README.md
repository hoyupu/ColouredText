# ColouredText

Colour the text of your Discord chat!
Just save [ColouredText.theme.css](https://hoyupu.github.io/ColouredText/ColouredText.theme.css) to your themes folder, it should work with any theme! The text colour also applies to embeds.<br>
<sub> * Only tested with BetterDiscord, please let me know if it fails on something else and I'll look at it when I can! </sub><br>
